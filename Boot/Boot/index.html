                        <p>Several references to Epsilon Program, both direct and indirect. There are hobos, who believe aliens are trying to take their sperm, pedestrians who cry Oh no! They've killed another truth seeker, and soapboxers, who rant about the paradise and how all others are slaves and are damned. Bluesy St. John claims she once ended up spending her Thursday nights in a group that prayed to Kifflom. Brendan Roberts suggests that he is a member of the cult, as noted when he says Kifflom at the end of his interview on Intelligent Agenda on Public Liberty Radio. The cult sponsors Chiropracticovernight.com, and is mentioned by the MyRoomOnline user Ravenvamp11 on her profile. In The Lost and Damned, there's a website called Morningwoodspa.com. One of the therapists is named Betty Mama Bear Wiffleton and her description says that Betty ran a cult with her ex-husband, who also happens to be her brother and uncle, which is a reference to Brother-Uncle, a term for an Epsilon member. It also says, She trained for three days at the certified shaman in the state of San Andreas. So, Betty appears to be an Epsilon Program member. Based on what her description said, stating that she was in San Andreas, the state where Epsilon Program is, and her running a cult. </p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>There is a building named <a href="#">The Fellowship Enlightenment Center</a> found within the game. It is a large, baby blue, building. Baby blue is the official color that represents the Epsilon Program. Many fans have theorized that this could be the manifestation of Epsilonism within . Cris Formage calls the Epsilon Cult a fellowship of likeminded people, and the building is named after a Fellowship. On the Epsilon Program's website, their places of worship are known as Enlightenment Centers, just as the building . Their tagline is Looking for answers? A backpacker pedestrian in  San Andreas, who is believed to be a member of the cult, has a dialogue stating Are you looking for spiritual answers? A phone number, that reads 808-555-1044, can be found up front. Fans have called this number both in game and in real life to no avail. A dialogue by Bluesy St. John mentions Thursday night, so there may be a connection with the phone number and calling it at the right time.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>There is a newspaper article by the <strong>Liberty Tree</strong> that is claimed to be The 13th Tenet of the Epsilon Tract.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>Moreover, on Blogsnobs, there is a user, <em>Inyapuper</em>, who is considered an anti-Epsilonist, as he has red hair.</p>
						<h2>Making History</h2>
						<p>Kifflom is one of three deities that Epsilon members pray to.

Kifflom's appearance is not mentioned at all in any official sources. The most famous depiction is described as a tall blue creature, humorously resembling some sort of large chicken with extended wings and four legs. Kifflom was represented like this in the well known Misterix mod, which is where the rumor originates.

Kifflom's behavior is unknown, but most accounts say that the creature is neutral and does not attack. It is believed that every time Kifflom comes to earth, he comes in a different form. For example, this time he is coming as a chicken.

There is very little proof that Kifflom exists in physical form in GTA San Andreas. Kifflom is mentioned various times on the Epsilon Program website, as well as in-game by several characters and pedestrians. Kifflom is also mentioned on the radio show, Area 53. Unfortunately, there is no proof of any creature resembling Kifflom within the game's internal files.</p>
						<h3>Religious beliefs</h3>
<p>The main ideals of the Epsilon Program are established on their website. The religions main deity is Kifflom, and members follow his twelve tenets: </p>
<ul>
							<li>The world is 157 years old, and it doesn't age.</li>
							<li>Dinosaurs are a lie that people believe because they are weak.</li>
							<li>ou are happy, you just donâ€™t know it.</li>
							<li>We all come from the same tree.</li>
							<li>Everyone is related to everyone else, except for people with red hair.</li>
							<li>Sperm does not exist - it is a lie spread by biology teachers - along with everything else you have ever been told.</li>
							<li>Men are supposed to lie with nine new partners a week. Women are supposed to lie with six, except for in July, when they must lie with five men a day.</li>
							<li>Aliens exist and are present on earth. If you have a birth mark, you may be descended from Kraff, the famous Emperor of the 4th Paradigm.</li>
						    <li>Trees talk, but only some people hear them.</li>

						<h2 class="blog-post-title">Inspiration</h2>
						<p class="blog-post-meta">July, 2017 by <a href="#">OMEGA</a></p>

						<p>The Epsilon Program seems to mostly be a parody of Scientology, a religion with a number of celebrity followers which has attracted controversy for being a "scam" or a "cult", like its GTA counterpart.

The cult is named after the Greek letter E. The name could possibly be in reference to the Epsilon Team, a Greek secret society. In the 1987 film Dragnet two cops are involved in investigating a crime. The crime gang is ran by a reverend, who has a voice similar to Cris Formage's. All members of the gang are in a cult, and perform a number of weird rituals throughout the movie. In certain scenes a quiet background music can be heard, identical to the one on the Epsilon Program website. The movie is shot in Los Angeles and some scenes are shot near the observatory - which is sometimes linked with Epsilon in the game. The short scene from the movie featuring both reverend's voice and the music can be seen here.</p>

			<h4>About</h4>
		<p>The Yellow door secret is explained in the <em>Epsilon Program</em> article.
The doors in the sky are actually yellow markers that allow you to walk through and end up inside of a building.
The only two yellow markers that are found in the sky are above Cluckin' Bell in the desert. They are far up in the sky and only reachable with cheats or hacks.
Reports say the two doors are only houses that were meant for Robbery Missions. Rockstar hides these interiors for a reason for nobody to find or reach</p>
